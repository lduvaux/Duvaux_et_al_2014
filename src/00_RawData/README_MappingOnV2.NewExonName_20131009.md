In order to decrease name problem, I removed the terminal white spaces of the following gene names:

- [1] "ApisSNMP3_ref|XP_001948133.1|_GENE ID: 100160056 LOC100160056 " --> "ApisSNMP3_ref|XP_001948133.1|_GENE ID: 100160056 LOC100160056"
- [2] "Steroid receptor RNA activator 1 (Steroid receptor RNA activator protein) (SRAP) (LOC100165713)_XM_001949797  " --> "Steroid receptor RNA activator 1 (Steroid receptor RNA activator protein) (SRAP) (LOC100165713)_XM_001949797"
- [3] "Na+/H+ exchanger domain containing 2 (LOC100165718)_XM_001948164  " --> "Na+/H+ exchanger domain containing 2 (LOC100165718)_XM_001948164"
- [4] "elongation factor 1-alpha (LOC100165786)_XM_001951252  " --> "elongation factor 1-alpha (LOC100165786)_XM_001951252"
